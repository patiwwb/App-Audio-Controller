# AppAudioController

A macOS menu-bar app for per-app audio control, built entirely on public macOS 14+ APIs.  
Per-app volume control, 10-band EQ, per-app audio routing, system volume, and more — no kext, no HAL plugin, no private SPI.

> **Requires macOS 14.4+** (uses `CATapDescription` + `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap`, available from 14.2 but fully supported from 14.4).  
> **Apple Silicon and Intel** both supported.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Per-app volume** | Independently control the volume of any running app (0 → 500%, with +40 dB EQ boost for quiet sources like calls) |
| **10-band parametric EQ** | Per-app equaliser — each source has its own curve |
| **Per-app audio routing** | Route Firefox to AirPods while Safari plays through MacBook Speakers, simultaneously |
| **Multiple sources at once** | Tap and control N apps independently at the same time |
| **System volume & mic** | Master output volume + microphone input gain with live keyboard-shortcut sync |
| **Audio Devices window** | Full device settings panel (volume, balance, sample rate, default device) — like a mini Audio MIDI Setup |
| **Smart auto-tap** | Starred (⭐) apps are automatically tapped when they start playing |
| **Favourites** | Pin apps for quick access and auto-tap |
| **Excluded sources** | Block specific apps from ever appearing in the list or being tapped |
| **Browser helper aliasing** | Chrome/Firefox renderer processes appear as "Google Chrome" / "Firefox" with correct icons |
| **Launch at Login** | One-click registration via `SMAppService` |
| **Dock pin toggle** | Optionally show the app in the Dock alongside the menu bar |

## Requirements

- macOS **14.4** or later
- Xcode Command Line Tools **or** Xcode (for `swift build`)
- No third-party dependencies beyond [`apple/swift-atomics`](https://github.com/apple/swift-atomics) (fetched automatically by SPM)

## Quick start

### First-time setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository in your prefered location
APP_NAME="App-Audio-Controller"

git clone "https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/${APP_NAME}.git"
cd "$APP_NAME"

# 2. Create the application bundle
APP_PATH="$HOME/Desktop/${APP_NAME}.app"

mkdir -p "$APP_PATH/Contents/MacOS"

cp Config/Info.plist "$APP_PATH/Contents/Info.plist"

# 3. Build the application
swift build -c release

# 4. Install the executable
cp ".build/release/AppAudioController" \
   "$APP_PATH/Contents/MacOS/AppAudioController"

# 5. Sign the application
codesign \
  --force \
  --deep \
  --entitlements Config/AppAudioController.entitlements \
  --sign - \
  "$APP_PATH"

# 6. Launch the application
open "$APP_PATH"
```

On first launch macOS will show **"AppAudioController.app would like access to record your system audio"** — click **Allow**. This appears once per signing identity.

### Updating after code changes

```bash
# Kill the running instance, rebuild, re-sign, relaunch
killall AppAudioController 2>/dev/null
cd ~/Desktop/AppAudioController
swift build -c release
cp .build/release/AppAudioController ~/Desktop/AppAudioController.app/Contents/MacOS/
codesign --force --deep \
  --entitlements Config/AppAudioController.entitlements \
  --sign - ~/Desktop/AppAudioController.app
open ~/Desktop/AppAudioController.app
```

> **Why `codesign` after every build?**  
> The audio-capture entitlement (`com.apple.security.device.audio-input`) must be embedded in the binary for the tap IOProc to receive audio instead of silence. Ad-hoc signing (`--sign -`) is sufficient for development; use a Developer ID certificate for distribution.

## How it works

### Core architecture

The single most important constraint: **a single `AVAudioEngine` can only have one `AudioDeviceID`** — you cannot capture from app X and play to device Y inside one engine. The solution is a split architecture joined by a lock-free ring buffer:

```
CAPTURE (ProcessTap — outside AVAudioEngine)
  CATapDescription(stereoMixdownOfProcesses: [processObjectID])
      → AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap
      → AudioHardwareCreateAggregateDevice  (tap + output device as clock master)
      → AudioDeviceCreateIOProcIDWithBlock  ──writes──▶  AudioRingBuffer (SPSC, lock-free)

PLAYBACK (TapProcessingEngine — standalone AVAudioEngine)
  AudioRingBuffer ──reads──▶ AVAudioSourceNode
      → AVAudioUnitEQ (10-band parametric)
      → mainMixerNode  (per-app volume, up to +40 dB via globalGain)
      → outputNode     (bound to chosen device via kAudioOutputUnitProperty_CurrentDevice)
```

Each tapped source gets its **own independent** ProcessTap + ring + AVAudioEngine chain. Changing one source's output device rebuilds only that chain; all others keep running.

### Key implementation notes

**Process tapping (`ProcessTap.swift`)**  
- `CATapDescription.processes` takes **process-object `AudioObjectID`s**, NOT `pid_t`. Passing a raw PID produces a silent tap — the #1 bug in this API.  
- The aggregate device references the tap by its **UUID string** (`desc.uuid.uuidString`), not by the tap's `AudioObjectID`.  
- Teardown order is critical: Stop → DestroyIOProcID → DestroyAggregateDevice → DestroyProcessTap. Wrong order leaks objects or leaves apps muted.

**Ring buffer (`AudioRingBuffer.swift`)**  
- Lock-free SPSC using `ManagedAtomic` (acquire/release ordering). No locks, allocations, or ARC on realtime threads.  
- Handles both interleaved and non-interleaved (planar) `AudioBufferList` layouts — process taps frequently deliver non-interleaved Float32.

**Browser helper aliasing (`AudioProcessEnumerator.swift`)**  
- `com.google.Chrome.helper` / `org.mozilla.firefox.renderer` are renamed to their parent app's name + icon by looking up the parent bundle ID via `NSRunningApplication.runningApplications(withBundleIdentifier:)`.  
- `activationPolicy == .regular` filter removes system daemons and UI agents (Control Centre, loginwindow, PowerChime) without a hard-coded denylist.

**Volume amplification (`TapProcessingEngine.swift`)**  
- 0–100%: `mainMixerNode.outputVolume` (attenuation)  
- 100–500%: `AVAudioUnitEQ.globalGain` in dB (0 → +40 dB = 100× amplitude). `outputVolume > 1.0` is silently clamped by AVAudioEngine; `globalGain` is not.

## Permissions

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` (Info.plist) | TCC consent string for `kTCCServiceAudioCapture`. Must be this key — **not** `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (different TCC class). |
| `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` (entitlements) | Without this, the tap is created successfully but the IOProc delivers **silence**. |
| App Sandbox enabled | Compatible with process taps using public APIs only. |

The consent dialog appears once. With ad-hoc signing (`--sign -`) it re-appears on every new build because the code hash changes. Use a stable Developer ID certificate to avoid this.

---

## Known limitations

- **Per-tab browser audio control** is not possible with public macOS APIs. Each browser tab playing audio appears as a separate process entry that can be controlled independently, but there is no public API to map a renderer PID to the tab title. The browser would need to expose this (e.g. via a browser extension + IPC).
- **Communication apps** (WhatsApp, Zoom, FaceTime) work best when added manually rather than auto-tapped. The `muteWhileTapped` re-routing can disrupt echo cancellation. Use the **System** volume slider for calls, or add the app manually and use the boost (100–500%) for quiet calls.
- **Ad-hoc signing** causes the audio-capture TCC consent to re-prompt on each new binary. This is a development-only limitation; a Developer ID certificate resolves it.
