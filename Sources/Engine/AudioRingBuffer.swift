//  AudioRingBuffer.swift
//  Engine
//
//  A lock-free, single-producer / single-consumer (SPSC) ring buffer of
//  INTERLEAVED Float32 frames in the tap's format.
//
//  ARCHITECTURAL ROLE (see BUILD SPEC):
//  ------------------------------------
//  The capture half and the playback half of this app are two *separate*
//  Core Audio clients running on two *independent device clocks*. They are
//  joined ONLY by this ring buffer:
//
//    PRODUCER  (sole writer):  ProcessTap's AudioDeviceIOBlock, invoked on the
//                              aggregate device's Core Audio REALTIME thread.
//                              It calls `write(_:frames:)` exactly once per IO
//                              cycle and nothing else.
//    CONSUMER  (sole reader):  TapProcessingEngine's AVAudioSourceNode render
//                              block, invoked on AVAudioEngine's REALTIME render
//                              thread. It calls `read(into:frames:)` exactly
//                              once per render cycle and nothing else.
//
//  Because exactly one realtime thread writes and exactly one realtime thread
//  reads, this is a strict SPSC structure. That lets us synchronise with just
//  two atomic indices (head/tail) using acquire/release ordering — no mutex,
//  no os_unfair_lock (which can priority-invert and is NOT safe to *spin* on a
//  realtime thread), no allocation, and no ARC traffic on the hot paths.
//
//  REALTIME SAFETY CONTRACT (load-bearing — every method below honours it):
//    * Backing storage is allocated EXACTLY ONCE, in `init`.
//    * `write` / `read` perform NO heap allocation, NO locking, NO ARC
//      retain/release, NO Foundation calls, NO logging, NO throwing.
//    * They touch only: the preallocated Float buffer, two atomic UInt indices,
//      and the caller-supplied AudioBufferList (whose memory the caller owns).
//
//  CLOCK DRIFT:
//  The producer (capture device clock) and consumer (output device clock) tick
//  at slightly different rates, so over time one will outpace the other. The
//  aggregate device's per-sub-tap drift compensation absorbs most of it; this
//  buffer's headroom (sized for ~100 ms by AudioTapManager) absorbs the rest.
//  On overflow we drop the incoming block (write returns false); on underflow
//  we report empty (read returns false) and the consumer emits silence.
